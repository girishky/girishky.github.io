I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/) in Taipei, working in the field of theoretical particle physics. My research work concerns study of flavor interactions of elementary particles to probe physics beyond the Standard Model.

I obtained my PhD in 2017 from [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/) (PhD work was carried-out at Physical Research Laboratory Ahemdabad) in India. I was a postdoctoral fellow at [TIFR](https://www.tifr.res.in/) (Mumbai, India) during 2017-2019, and joined National Taiwan University in 2019.

My research publications are available at [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1418749), [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6051-2495), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T7OmqrMAAAAJ&hl).

My latest CV is available [here]().
