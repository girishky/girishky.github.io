I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/physics_and_astronomy/index.php), working in the field of theoretical particle physics. My primary research concerns study of flavor interactions of elementary particles to probe physics beyond the Standard Model.

I obtained my PhD in 2017 from [IIT Gandhinagar](https://iitgn.ac.in/) (PhD work was carried-out at Physical Research Laboratory Ahemdabad) in India. After that, I held postdoc positions at [TIFR](https://www.tifr.res.in/), Mumbai  during 2017-2019, and [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), Taipei during 2019-2023. I joined University of South Carolina in Spetmeber, 2023.

My research publications are available at [Inspire-HEP](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1418749), [ORCiD](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6051-2495), and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=T7OmqrMAAAAJ&hl).

My latest CV is available [here](https://girishky.github.io/assets/cv.pdf).
